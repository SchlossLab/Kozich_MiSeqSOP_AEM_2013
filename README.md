Reproduction and exploration of data from [Kozich et al (2013)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3753973/)
=======

write.paper
-------

You can generate the final document by "simply" entering the following from a terminal on a
Mac OSX or Linux computer:

```
make write.paper
```

But that's probably a ***really bad*** idea. The data contained within represents 13 MiSeq sequencing
runs and would probably take several weeks to run on a single node of a computer. Unfortuantely,
you probably need to go through an individually build the targets of the Makefile on multiple
nodes. If you have suggestions on how to improve the Makefile to make it more automated for people
(i.e. me) using a pbs job scheduler, please let me know.
